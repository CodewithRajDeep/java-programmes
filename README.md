This project is moreover an initiative taken by me  to keep a habit of coding to keep yourself in right track in your programming language. In this project - Java-programmes, I had start this series from a very basic beginner level and further we will slowly move to intermediate level and then advanced level. 

I'd encourage you to clone and rename the project to use for your own purposes. It's a good start.

* Create a new folder in your system 
* Open your folder in your working studio whichever you like
* Create files and good to start with this series.
